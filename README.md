# 🧠 AI TEST — Web Application for Test and Glossary Generation

**AI TEST** is a web application designed to automatically generate **tests** and **glossaries** from educational materials such as lectures, presentations, and documents.  
The system uses Large Language Models (LLMs) provided by OpenAI to analyze the text and generate meaningful questions, answers, and definitions.
